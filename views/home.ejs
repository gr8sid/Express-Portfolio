Hi, welcome to the world of Development Under Sidharth Choudhary!!!
Iâ€™m so thrilled to get this chance to welcome you to the exciting world of COMPUTER PROGRAMMING!
Anyone can imagine that someone like me who has been programming computers since high school 
(long before high schools ever taught programming) has seen a lot over the past 5 years. 
And I like what I see!<br>
The most important thing is that <b>programming computers is a lot of fun!</b>
<br>
It does not matter if you are young or old - you will enjoy learning 
how to program. You will finally be able to get a computer to do exactly what 
you want it to do! That's what programming is all about: telling a computer 
step-by-step exactly what to do next. In a way, you are the author of a program 
which will be your creation, your own personal set of rules for computer telling 
the computer exactly what to do next.
